I am Florian Amsallem, French computer engineer graduated from `EPITA
<http://www.epita.fr/>`__ (a computer science school near Paris).  I am deeply
interested in **programming** and **image rendering**. I mainly code in Rust, C++
and Python.

Projects
~~~~~~~~

Some of my favorite personal projects:

-  `my-git <https://github.com/flomonster/my-git>`__: a re-implementation of the
   git version control system in Rust.
-  `easy-gltf <https://github.com/flomonster/easy-gltf>`__: a Rust library to
   load gltf scenes easily and ready to render.

School projects:

-  `Rasterizer <https://github.com/flomonster/rasterizer>`_: an implementation of a 3D
   rasterizer in c++.
-  `Bee Wings Intersection <https://github.com/bjorn-grape/bee-wing-intersection>`__:
   detection of bee's veins intersection written in python.
-  `Aegina <https://github.com/JMounier/Aegina>`__:
   a survival 3D multiplayer game made with C#/Unity.
-  `OCR <https://github.com/flomonster/ocr>`__: optical character
   recognition software written in C.

Teaching Assistant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While studying at `Epita <http://www.epita.fr/>`__ I was part of the teaching
assistant team. The assistant team's objectives are to teach programming to the
EPITA's first year students. For this I had to write project topics, present
these projects and supervise practical work sessions.

Within the team I had a special role (called *"moulette"*), the person in charge of the
notation tools. Most of the projects submitted by the students had to be evaluated
automatically. For this purpose a set of tools are developed, maintained and
improved by successive team of teaching assistant.

Here is a list of the most important tasks I have done as a teaching assistant:

- Replace **Jenkins** used to run the correction of a project on all students by
  **Argo**. This modification was motivated by the establishment of a **Kubernetes**
  by the sysadmin.
- Add a feature to evaluate projects in "real time". The idea of this feature is
  instead of evaluating a student's project after the deadline, to evaluate it
  every time the student wants by tagging his commit. The main difficulty was to
  be able to handle a lot of simultaneous requests.
- Responsible of the **chess project**. Chess is an historical C++ project given to
  EPITA students, the idea is to code an AI to the chess game. I had to improve
  the subject and recode a powerful ref.

Algorithmic contest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Prologin <https://prologin.org/>`_
-----------------------------------

I always was interested in algorithms. So in highschool I participated to
`Prologin <https://prologin.org/>`_ the french national computer science contest.
I went all the way to the final stage. After this experience I joined in as an
organizer.

`Google Hash Code <https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Hash Code <https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/>`_ is a team
programming competition, organized by Google, for students and professionals
from all over the world. I have participated in the 2019 and 2020 edition.

During the 2020 edition qualifications, my team finished at the 120th place (world
ranking). Among other things, we used a **genetic algorithm** to optimize our solution.
You can see the repository `here <https://github.com/Fangui/hashcode_2020>`_.

`SWERC <https://swerc.eu/2020/about/>`_
---------------------------------------

`SWERC <https://swerc.eu/2020/about/>`_  is a 5-hour on-site programming contest
for teams of three students. It is open to several European countries and serves
as the regional selection phase for the `International Collegiate Programming Contest <https://icpc.global/>`_.
I have participated in the 2017, 2018 and 2019 editions.
